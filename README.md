Create an interface or abstract base class 'Shape'. Implement three concrete Shapes: 'Circle', 'Rectangle', 'Triangle'. Apply the visitor pattern to your data model. Write an AreaVisitor that computes the area of the shapes. Write a program that makes arbitrary instances of the data model and uses the AreaVisitor to calculate the total area of the instances.
